# Symfony-API-Todo-list

In this project, I developed a **REST API** using **Symfony** 6, leveraging the power of Doctrine to define entities that accurately represented our API's data model, thereby establishing a structured and efficient means of interacting with the underlying database. Employing specialized Symfony controllers tailored for JSON responses, I skillfully crafted endpoints capable of seamlessly handling incoming requests and delivering appropriate JSON representations of our valuable resources. Additionally, I successfully implemented comprehensive **CRUD** operations, enabling the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of data through the API, thus facilitating comprehensive data manipulation.

To ensure a smooth user experience and robustness, I diligently established **error handling** mechanisms to gracefully manage exceptions and communicate relevant error messages to clients. Moreover, I incorporated a sophisticated **pagination system** that allowed clients to retrieve data in manageable chunks, effectively enhancing performance and optimizing the overall user experience.

**Security** has importance in this project, By utilizing authentication header tokens, I successfully restricted access to protected resources, ensuring that only authorized users could interact with our API.

To bolster the reliability and accuracy of our API, I extensively utilized PHPUnit and Symfony's functional testing framework. These rigorous tests were designed to verify the correctness and robustness of our API, instilling confidence in its functionality and adherence to desired specifications.

Through this simple project, I have not only honed my technical skills in Symfony 6 and REST API development but also demonstrated a strong commitment to creating a professional, secure, and highly functional API.
