# Symfony-API-Todo-list

In this project, I developed a **REST API** using **Symfony** 6, making the most of Doctrine to define entities that accurately represented the data model for our API. This approach helped establish a structured and efficient way to interact with the underlying database. I used specialized Symfony controllers customized for this purpose to handle JSON responses effectively.

To enable comprehensive data manipulation, I successfully implemented **CRUD** operations, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data through the API. This functionality greatly facilitated data management.

A smooth user experience and robustness were crucial considerations, so I carefully implemented **error handling** mechanisms to manage exceptions and communicate relevant error messages to clients gracefully. Additionally, I incorporated a sophisticated **pagination system** that allowed clients to retrieve data in manageable chunks, enhancing performance and optimizing the overall user experience.

**Security** has importance in this project. By utilizing authentication header tokens, I effectively restricted access to protected resources, ensuring that only authorized users could interact with our API.

To ensure the reliability and accuracy of our API, I extensively utilized PHPUnit and Symfony's functional testing framework. These rigorous tests were designed to verify the correctness and robustness of our API, instilling confidence in its functionality and adherence to desired specifications.

Overall, this project allowed me to sharpen my technical skills in Symfony 6 and REST API development, while also demonstrating a solid commitment to creating a professional, secure, and highly functional API.
